 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * The API layer consists of several functions that allow user to do
 * operations with flash in a unified way. As a result, future device changes
 * will not necessarily lead to the code changes in the application environments.
 * In this %norflash library we support AMD and INTEL command set.
 * The API layar code accesses the Flash memory by calling the low-level code,
 * so users do not have to concern themselves with the details of the special
 * command sequences.
 *
 * \section Usage
 *
 * -# Flash program using NORFLASH_WriteData().
 *    - The Program command is used to modify the data stored at the
 *      specified device address.
 * -# erase a block within the flash using NORFLASH_EraseSector().
 *    - Flash erase is performed on a block basis. An entire block is
 *      erased each time an erase command sequence is given.
 * -# erase whole blocks within the flash using NORFLASH_EraseChip().
 * -# NORFLASH_Reset() function can be issued, between Bus Write cycles
 *    before the start of a program or erase operation, to return the
 *    device to read mode.
 * -# NORFLASH_ReadDeviceID() is used to retrieve information
 *    about the Flash Device type.
 * -# NORFLASH_ReadManufactoryID() is used to retrieve information
 *    about the Flash Device Manufactory ID.
