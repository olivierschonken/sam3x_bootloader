 *
 * \section Purpose
 *
 * The INTERL %norflash Low-level driver code implement procedures to program
 * basic operations described INTEL-specified command set flash devices.
 * The various commands recognized by the devices are listed in the Commands
 * Tables provided in the corresponding INTEL command set compatible flash
 * datasheets. All operation functions are blocked, they wait for the
 * completion of an operation by polling the status register.
 *
 * \section Usage
 * -# Flash program using INTEL_Write_Data().
 *    - The Program command is used to modify the data stored at the
 *      specified device address. Programming can only change bits
 *      from ¡®1¡¯ to ¡®0¡¯. It may be necessary to erase the block before
 *      programming to addresses within it. Programming modifies a single
 *      Word at a time using static function intel_Program(). Programming
 *      larger amounts of data must be done in one Word at a time by
 *      giving a Program command, waiting for the command to complete,
 *      giving the next Program command and so on.
 * -# erase a block within the flash using INTEL_EraseSector().
 *    - Flash erase is performed on a block basis. An entire block is
 *      erased each time an erase command sequence is given.
 * -# erase whole blocks within the flash using INTEL_EraseChip().
 * -# INTEL_Reset() function can be issued, between Bus Write cycles
 *    before the start of a program or erase operation, to return the
 *    device to read mode.
 * -# INTEL_ReadDeviceID() is used to retrieve information
 *    about the Flash Device type.
 * -# INTEL_ReadManufactoryId() is used to retrieve information
 *    about the Flash Device Manufactory ID.
